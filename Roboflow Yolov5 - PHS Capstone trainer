This notebook shows training on **your own custom objects**. Many thanks to Ultralytics for putting this repository together - we hope that in combination with clean data management tools at Roboflow, this technologoy will become easily accessible to any developer wishing to use computer vision in their projects.\n","\n","### Accompanying Blog Post\n","\n","We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on [how to train YOLOv5](https://blog.roboflow.ai/how-to-train-yolov5-on-a-custom-dataset/), concurrently.\n","\n","### Steps Covered in this Tutorial\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to train YOLOv5 on your custom objects. We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data.\n","\n","To train our detector we take the following steps:\n","\n","* Install YOLOv5 dependencies\n","* Download custom YOLOv5 object detection data\n","* Write our YOLOv5 Training configuration\n","* Run YOLOv5 training\n","* Evaluate YOLOv5 performance\n","* Visualize YOLOv5 training data\n","* Run YOLOv5 inference on test images\n","* Export saved YOLOv5 weights for future inference\n","\n","\n","\n","### **About**\n","\n","[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) enables teams to deploy custom computer vision models quickly and accurately. Convert data from to annotation format, assess dataset health, preprocess, augment, and more. It's free for your first 1000 source images.\n","\n","**Looking for a vision model available via API without hassle?
